usePrefetch prefetches next episode even if next episode doesn't exist

prefetch doesn't really work with the current new watch page set subtitles

next episode work even if all episodes aint realesed yet since anilist just set the final counter right away

support for furigana

make resend optional so anyone can self host the app with full functioanlity

for is refetching add a loading overlay on the refetchinf thing
1- the subtitle styles component

better error handling
1- in case subtitle files don't exist for a certain episode yet
> currently on this route http://localhost:3000/watch/149118/8

http://localhost:3000/watch/161645/24 shows no subtitle found even tho there is
apothecary season 2 shows 24 episodes even tho they only 19
> anilist adds anime with the total planned episode count, even if not all episodes have aired yet.

we changed how displayValue works in the use-styles-controller maybe in the others too ?

what is .ssa, maybe will support it too ? check it out on death note ep 15 too

puase player on definition trigger or hover or click or none !!!!

sometimes the proxy fails -> maybe add a refetch or something in that case

later add a protips page or something to show tips like the ctrl + c copy the current cue text !!
or basically a hotkeys instructions when we add the rest (if there is)

begin where you left off > save where the user ended last time they watched a certain episode
prob not that important tho 
-> maybe the best way to implement this is to save watched episode an a history table and each video with its own how much the user have seen of it

subtitles sometime take quite a bit of time before being addded to jimaku
so in that case give a warning to the user and stop the hook before the give an error

add the ability to disable auto scroll to the current cue and the ability to customize the countdown when the user is scrolling before it returns to the current cue

update the skeletons for general settings and subtitle styles since you chagned the content

hide spoilers

watch or info page
> Choose whether to go to the info page or watch page when selecting an anime.

maybe on the info page if its an anime of 1 episodes just prefetch it right away

auto add to list

so when we log as anon we should invalidate the session query a7a

dialog z-index > toast z-index => bad UX 
i suppose it can be fixed using createPortal from react

use cache for session which are being fetched from the server ??

input validation/sanitization 

check turoborepo

check if memoizing subtitle cue solve the performance issue on vivaldi

implement caching for the mapper

episodes metadata for the episode selector

for schedules dont use anilist its based on japanese tv

preview subtitle for when the settings change (not important)
