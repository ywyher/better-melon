# Bugs
1. getSentencesForCue delay doesnt really work well with delay
2. so when we log as anon we should invalidate the session query
3. check the index>header file for an error with the dialog wrapper
4. dialog z-index > toast z-index => bad UX i suppose it can be fixed using createPortal from react
 
# Notes
1. there is built-in getAccessToken no need to listAccountsWithFullData on anilist !!
2. we changed how displayValue works in the use-styles-controller maybe in the others too ?
3. sometimes the proxy fails -> maybe add a refetch or something in that case
4. update the skeletons for general settings and subtitle styles since you chagned the content
5. maybe on the info page if its an anime of 1 episodes just prefetch it right away
6. use cache for session which are being fetched from the server ??
7. check turoborepo
8. for schedules dont use anilist its based on japanese tv
