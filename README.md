# What is it ?
An [Animleon](https://www.animelon.com/) alternative that aims to overcome all animelon's inconvenients

# Why ?
Animelon doesn’t provide all animes, and its entries are rarely updated, making it difficult for learners who want to watch modern anime with subtitles. That’s why I decided to create this website—to offer the latest animes with subtitles, along with real-time Japanese subtitle definitions, providing a more feature-rich alternative.

# Roadmap
> [!warning]
> This project is still in beta

> [!note]
> The only crucial feature not yet implemented is definition-on-select functionality. You can use Yomitan as an alternative for now.
